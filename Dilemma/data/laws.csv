Cap-and-Trade,-5,-1,"A market-based environmental policy where a government sets a cap on total emissions and issues permits for companies to emit greenhouse gases. Companies that reduce their emissions can sell unused permits to others, incentivizing overall reductions."
CO2 credit Trade Ban,-20,-1,"A policy that bans the buying and selling of carbon credits or allowances, effectively prohibiting companies from offsetting their emissions through trade and instead requiring direct reductions."
CAFE,-5,-1,"Regulations that set minimum fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, aiming to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by requiring automakers to meet average efficiency targets for their fleets."
Invest in Nuclear power,-20,-2,A policy that directs resources and support towards the development and expansion of nuclear energy infrastructure as a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels.
Invest in Wind Turbine,-5,-0.5,"Policies focused on funding the research, development, and installation of wind energy technology to increase renewable energy capacity."
Develop public transport,-15,-0.5,"Initiatives aimed at improving and expanding public transportation networks, reducing traffic congestion, lowering carbon emissions, and promoting sustainable mobility."
Build Coal Mine,5,2,"A policy that allows or encourages the construction of new coal mines, typically for energy production or export, though it may contribute to environmental and climate concerns due to coal's high carbon emissions."
Force Veganism,-5,-1,"A controversial policy that would mandate a vegan diet for individuals or certain sectors of society, often justified by arguments regarding reducing environmental impact from livestock farming, particularly methane emissions."
incentives for Electric Vehicles,5,-1,"Financial or tax incentives (such as rebates, credits, or subsidies) aimed at promoting the purchase and use of electric vehicles, thereby reducing fossil fuel dependence and carbon emissions."
incentives for Diesel Vehicles,15,1.5,"Policies that provide financial benefits or tax breaks for the purchase of diesel-powered vehicles, often in the context of fuel efficiency and long-distance travel, but with concerns about diesel's contribution to air pollution."
Build Coal Powerplant,5,1,"The construction of new coal-fired power plants to generate electricity. While coal is a reliable and historically important energy source, it is a major contributor to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions."
Build LNG Powerplant,5,0.5,"Policies to construct Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) power plants that burn natural gas to generate electricity, offering a cleaner alternative to coal but still a fossil fuel with some environmental concerns."
Rewilding Programs,-5,-1,"Conservation efforts aimed at restoring ecosystems to their natural state, including the reintroduction of species that were previously lost, to improve biodiversity and carbon sequestration."
Renewable Energy Standards,-10,-1,"Legislation that mandates a certain percentage of energy generation come from renewable sources like wind, solar, or hydropower, encouraging a transition away from fossil fuels."
Tax Cuts for Fossil Fuel,10,2,"Tax reductions or exemptions for the extraction and use of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, often justified as a way to promote energy independence or economic growth, but criticized for supporting high-emission industries."
Fast-Track Industrial Development,10,1.5,"Policies that streamline regulatory processes to accelerate industrial growth and infrastructure development, often at the expense of environmental considerations and long-term sustainability."
Tourism and Luxury Development,5,0.5,"A policy focus on expanding tourism infrastructure and developing luxury accommodations and attractions, which can stimulate economic growth but may also place stress on natural resources and local communities."
Solar Energy Expansion,-20,-2,"Policies to increase the use of solar power through incentives, subsidies, and investment in solar technology and infrastructure, aiming to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and promote clean energy."
Eco-City Development,-5,-1,"Urban planning and construction policies aimed at creating sustainable cities, integrating green spaces, renewable energy, efficient public transport, and low-carbon infrastructure to reduce environmental impacts."
Sustainable Mining Regulations,-10,-0.5,"Laws that impose environmentally friendly practices on mining operations, ensuring that the extraction of minerals and resources does not cause excessive harm to ecosystems, water sources, or communities."
