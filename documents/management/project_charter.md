# Project Charter

**Project Name**: Serious Game  
**Game Title**: Dilemma  

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Purpose**:  
The purpose of this project is to create a serious game called *Dilemma* that will help players gather knowledge about climate change and understand the rationale behind environmental policies proposed in France. By engaging players with real-world scenarios, the game aims to increase awareness, foster critical thinking, and equip players with knowledge to better understand political and environmental decisions.

## 2. Project Objectives and Goals

**Primary Objective:**

The main goal of Dilemma is to sensitize players to the complexities of climate policy by presenting them with choices that illustrate the consequences of various actions. This will empower players with critical insights into climate-related policies.

**Success Criteria:**

The game will be deemed successful if, by the end of gameplay, players report learning something new related to climate change or policy.

## 3. Scope Overview

**In-Scope:**

- A world map interface focused on France with interactive elements.
- Two gauges representing country resources money and global temperature.
- Three interactive buttons for Diplomacy, Laws, and Research, allowing players to make decisions in each category.

**Out-of-Scope:**

- Cinematic cutscenes or animations due to time constraints.
- Multiplayer features or controlling multiple countries, as the focus will solely be on France to ensure relevance and depth.
