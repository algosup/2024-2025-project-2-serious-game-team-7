# Weekly Report - Week 4

## Overview

This week was marked by challenges in maintaining team motivation due to a lack of dedicated project time and school-related events that contributed to fatigue among team members. Despite these hurdles, we made progress in several areas, successfully delivering the technical specification and continuing to refine the design aspects of the game. However, progress on the core mechanics of the game stalled, which will need to be addressed in the coming weeks.

## Accomplishments

1.	**Technical Specification**

	-	Delivered the technical specification document on time, providing a clear foundation for the development phase.
2.	**Game Design**
	-	Continued work on the design elements of the game, including interface layouts, map design, and graphical elements.

## Challenges

1.	**Team Motivation**
	-	Fatigue from cumulative workload and school events led to a noticeable dip in team motivation throughout the week.
2.	**Core Mechanics Progress**
	-	No significant progress was made on the core mechanics of the game, delaying a crucial part of the development phase.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Core Mechanics Development**
   - Focus on implementing the core mechanics of the game, including the interaction systems for Diplomacy, Laws, and Research.
2.	**Design Refinement**
	- 	Finalize key design elements and ensure their integration aligns with gameplay requirements.
3.	**Testing Plan Draft**
	- 	Finalize the testing plan to outline QA strategies and assign responsibilities.
  
4.	**Boosting Team Productivity**
	- 	Implement measures to improve team motivation and ensure that the next week is more productive.

## Conclusion

While this week presented challenges related to team motivation and project progress, we successfully met our commitment to deliver the technical specification and continued to advance the design aspects of the game. Moving forward, addressing the stalled progress on core mechanics will be our top priority, alongside fostering a more productive team environment.
