# Weekly Report - Week 2

## Overview

This week continued with a similar dynamic to the previous week as no dedicated project time was allocated. Instead, we focused on learning and refining our approach through Konstantinosâ€™ game design courses, which provided valuable insights into the fundamentals of game development.

## Accomplishments

1.	**Functional Specification (First Version)**
	-	Completed the initial draft of the functional specification document. This will allow time next week for review and feedback from the program manager.

2.	**Project Charter**
	-	Finalized the project charter, including setting the main milestones and clearly defining the project scope.

3.	**Risk Evaluation**
	-	Conducted a thorough risk evaluation, identifying potential risks and mitigation strategies.

4.	**Godot Test Project**
	-	Software engineers completed their first project using Godot, which significantly improved their understanding of its key concepts and functionality.

## Challenges

1.	**Technical Specification Delays**
	-	Due to the lack of project time this week, we were unable to begin drafting the technical specification as planned.

2.	**Prototyping**
	-	Creating the prototype proved more challenging than initially anticipated, leading to slower progress.

## Plan for Next Week

1.	**Prototype Completion**
	-	Focus on ensuring the prototype is completed on time, aligning with the Gantt chart schedule.
    
2.	**Technical Specifications**
	-	Start drafting the technical specifications document to ensure no further delays in development.

3.	**Tutorial Planning**
	-	Begin brainstorming ideas for the in-game tutorial with input from the technical writer.
    
4.	**Testing Phase Planning**
	-	Start planning the testing phase to ensure a smooth and organized development process.

5.	**Game Design**
	-	Initiate work on the future visual design of the game to establish the graphical direction.

## Conclusion

Despite the challenges faced this week, including delays and the absence of project time, the team demonstrated strong determination and effective communication. We are optimistic about catching up on delays next week as dedicated project time becomes available. This newfound productivity will mark the beginning of a more hands-on development phase, driving us closer to our milestones.
