3.	**Technical Specifications**
     - Made substantial progress on drafting the technical specifications, aligning with the conventions and constraints defined by the tech lead.

## Challenges

1. **Team Attendance**
   - Team members were absent throughout the week, which required us to rely on Slack for communication instead of collaborating in person.
2. **Decreased Motivation**
   - A lack of motivation among some team members slowed progress, requiring additional effort to maintain momentum.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Complete Technical Specifications**
