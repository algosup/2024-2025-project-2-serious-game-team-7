# Weekly Report - Week 1

## Overview

This week marked the beginning of our project with a focus on understanding the concept of a serious game and brainstorming ideas for the game mechanics and themes. We outlined the project’s key steps and created a comprehensive Gantt chart to guide our timeline and milestones. Additionally, we prepared a one-page document summarizing the main mechanics of the game and delivered a pitch deck to present and confirm the idea with a larger audience of students.

## Accomplishments

1.	**Understanding Serious Game Concepts**
	-	The team conducted discussions to grasp the fundamentals of serious games and their educational and engaging aspects.

2.	**Brainstorming**
	-	Collaborative ideation sessions to define the game’s mechanics and the theme we want to emphasize.

3.	**One-Page Document**
	-	Drafted a concise summary of the game’s main mechanics and its intended impact.

4.	**Planning**
	-	Outlined the project’s steps and created a Gantt chart to guide the timeline and milestones.

5.	**Pitch Deck**
	-	Created and presented a pitch deck to a large audience of students to confirm the game idea and gather feedback.

## Challenges

1.	**Idea Alignment**

2.	**Scope Definition**
	-	It was difficult to refine and reduce the game scope to fit within the seven-week project timeframe while maintaining an impactful idea.

3.	**Limited Experience**
	-	The team faced challenges due to a lack of experience in game design and development, making the brainstorming and scoping process slower.

## Plan for Next Week

1.	**Risk Evaluation**
	-	Conduct a risk assessment to identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies.

2.	**Functional Specification**
	-	Write the majority of the functional specification document, allowing one additional week for improvement and corrections.

3.	**GitHub Repository Convention**
	-	Establish conventions for the GitHub repository to standardize team coding practices, naming conventions, and file organization.

4.	**Godot Exploration**
	-	Start exploring the Godot game engine and create a test project to gather foundational knowledge and prepare for development.

## Conclusion

The project has had a promising start with strong team spirit and effective communication. The collaborative atmosphere and early alignment on objectives provide a solid foundation for achieving project milestones and delivering quality results.
