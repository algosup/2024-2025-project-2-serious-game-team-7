## Weekly Report - Week 1

### Overview

This week marked the beginning of our project with a focus on understanding the concept of a serious game and brainstorming ideas for the game mechanics and themes. We outlined the project’s key steps and created a comprehensive Gantt chart to guide our timeline and milestones. Additionally, we prepared a one-page document summarizing the main mechanics of the game and delivered a pitch deck to present and confirm the idea with a larger audience of students.

### Accomplishments

1.	**Understanding Serious Game Concepts**
	-	The team conducted discussions to grasp the fundamentals of serious games and their educational and engaging aspects.

2.	**Brainstorming**
	-	Collaborative ideation sessions to define the game’s mechanics and the theme we want to emphasize.

3.	**One-Page Document**
	-	Drafted a concise summary of the game’s main mechanics and its intended impact.

4.	**Planning**
	-	Outlined the project’s steps and created a Gantt chart to guide the timeline and milestones.

5.	**Pitch Deck**
	-	Created and presented a pitch deck to a large audience of students to confirm the game idea and gather feedback.

### Challenges

1.	**Idea Alignment**
	-	Finding a concept that engaged and pleased everyone in the team was initially challenging.
                                                   
2.	**Scope Definition**
	-	It was difficult to refine and reduce the game scope to fit within the seven-week project timeframe while maintaining an impactful idea.

3.	**Limited Experience**
	-	The team faced challenges due to a lack of experience in game design and development, making the brainstorming and scoping process slower.

### Plan for Next Week

1.	**Risk Evaluation**
	-	Conduct a risk assessment to identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies.

2.	**Functional Specification**
	-	Write the majority of the functional specification document, allowing one additional week for improvement and corrections.

3.	**GitHub Repository Convention**
	-	Establish conventions for the GitHub repository to standardize team coding practices, naming conventions, and file organization.

4.	**Godot Exploration**
	-	Start exploring the Godot game engine and create a test project to gather foundational knowledge and prepare for development.

### Conclusion

The project has had a promising start with strong team spirit and effective communication. The collaborative atmosphere and early alignment on objectives provide a solid foundation for achieving project milestones and delivering quality results.

## Weekly Report - Week 2

### Overview

This week continued with a similar dynamic to the previous week as no dedicated project time was allocated. Instead, we focused on learning and refining our approach through Konstantinos’ game design courses, which provided valuable insights into the fundamentals of game development.

### Accomplishments

1.	**Functional Specification (First Version)**
	-	Completed the initial draft of the functional specification document. This will allow time next week for review and feedback from the program manager.

2.	**Project Charter**
	-	Finalized the project charter, including setting the main milestones and clearly defining the project scope.

3.	**Risk Evaluation**
	-	Conducted a thorough risk evaluation, identifying potential risks and mitigation strategies.

4.	**Godot Test Project**
	-	Software engineers completed their first project using Godot, which significantly improved their understanding of its key concepts and functionality.

### Challenges

1.	**Technical Specification Delays**
	-	Due to the lack of project time this week, we were unable to begin drafting the technical specification as planned.

2.	**Prototyping**
	-	Creating the prototype proved more challenging than initially anticipated, leading to slower progress.

### Plan for Next Week

1.	**Prototype Completion**
	-	Focus on ensuring the prototype is completed on time, aligning with the Gantt chart schedule.
    
2.	**Technical Specifications**
	-	Start drafting the technical specifications document to ensure no further delays in development.

3.	**Tutorial Planning**
	-	Begin brainstorming ideas for the in-game tutorial with input from the technical writer.
    
4.	**Testing Phase Planning**
	-	Start planning the testing phase to ensure a smooth and organized development process.

5.	**Game Design**
	-	Initiate work on the future visual design of the game to establish the graphical direction.

### Conclusion

Despite the challenges faced this week, including delays and the absence of project time, the team demonstrated strong determination and effective communication. We are optimistic about catching up on delays next week as dedicated project time becomes available. This newfound productivity will mark the beginning of a more hands-on development phase, driving us closer to our milestones.

## Weekly Report - Week 3

### Overview

This week brought significant changes in our motivation and the project’s progress. Despite some setbacks, the team remained focused on the project objectives. However, the average pace and time for task completion were lower than expected, as some team members were absent due to personal reasons. 

### Accomplishments

1. **Functional Specification**
    - Finalized and delivered the functional specification document as planned by the end of the week.

2.	**Prototype Completion**
   - Completed the prototype, representing a significant advancement in the development phase. The prototype now includes core mechanics and foundational gameplay elements.
  
3.	**Technical Specifications**
   - Made substantial progress on drafting the technical specifications, aligning with the conventions and constraints defined by the tech lead.

### Challenges

1. **Team Attendance**
   - Team members were absent throughout the week, which required us to rely on Slack for communication instead of collaborating in person.
2. **Decreased Motivation**
   - A lack of motivation among some team members slowed progress, requiring additional effort to maintain momentum.

### Plan for Next Week

1. **Complete Technical Specifications**
   - Finalize and refine the technical specifications to ensure the development phase adheres to all conventions and constraints defined by the tech lead.
2. **Advanced Game Features**
   - Begin developing more advanced game features, building on the progress made with the prototype.
3. **Test Plan Draft**
   - Start drafting the test plan to define the testing strategy, phases, and responsibilities.

### Conclusion

This week marked an important step forward in the project, with the completion of the functional specification and prototype providing a solid foundation for further development. Despite challenges in motivation and attendance, the team demonstrated resilience and maintained progress. As we move into next week, the focus will shift toward finalizing the technical specifications, implementing advanced features, and laying the groundwork for a structured testing phase.
