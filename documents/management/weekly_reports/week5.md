# Weekly Report - Week 5

## Overview

This week was impacted by limited project time, with only two session available for collaborative work. This constraint made it difficult to effectively track and align the work of all team members. Despite these challenges, we successfully delivered the test plan as scheduled. To address delays in the coding tasks, the team made the strategic decision to reduce the scope of the game by limiting the number of choices in each category and reducing the total number of turns from 50 to 10.

## Accomplishments
1.	**Test Plan**

	- Successfully delivered the test plan, outlining the QA strategies and ensuring a structured approach to testing.
2.	**Scope Adjustment**

	- Reduced the number of choices in each category (Diplomacy, Laws, Research) and scaled down the total number of turns to 10. This adjustment ensures a more realistic timeline for completing the code base.
3.	**Data Structures Setup**

	- Established data structures to facilitate software engineering tasks, improving organization and enhancing collaborative work among developers.

## Challenges
1.	**Limited Project Time**

	- With only two project session this week, it was challenging to monitor progress and collaborate effectively as a team.
2.	**Coding Delays**

	- Progress on the code base fell behind schedule, necessitating the reduction in game scope to meet deadlines.

## Plan for Next Week
1.	**Complete the Code Base**

	- With 7 project sessions scheduled, the team aims to finalize the game’s code base.
2.	**Team Engagement**

	- Ensure every team member is fully engaged and focused during the week to maximize productivity and meet development goals.
3.	**Testing and Debugging**

	- Begin initial testing and debugging to identify and resolve any major issues in preparation for the final stages of development.

## Conclusion

Despite limited project time, the team successfully delivered the test plan and strategically adjusted the game’s scope to ensure it remains feasible within the remaining timeline. Next week’s priority will be completing the code base, with the additional project time providing an opportunity for significant progress. Full team engagement will be crucial to achieving success and meeting our goals.
