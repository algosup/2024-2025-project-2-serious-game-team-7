# Post-Mortem Report

## Summary

The project aimed to create a serious game to educate players about climate change, focusing on the rationale behind French environmental policies. The game was designed with a reduced scope to ensure feasibility within a seven-week timeline. Despite challenges in motivation and team availability, the team successfully delivered a functional game.

## What Went Well

### Key Successes
- **On-Time Deliverables**: All major deliverables, including the functional specification, test plan, technical specification, and final code base, were completed on time.
- **Collaborative Decision-Making**: Mid-project scope adjustments were handled effectively, ensuring that deadlines were met without sacrificing quality.
- **Prototype Completion**: Early prototyping helped clarify key mechanics and guided subsequent development.
- **Team Adaptability**: Despite challenges, the team adjusted to absences and limited project time, maintaining progress.

## What Didn’t Go Well

### Challenges and Issues
1. **Team Motivation**  
   - Motivation waned during Weeks 4 and 5, leading to slower progress and requiring extra effort to maintain momentum.  
2. **Limited Project Time**  
   - The lack of consistent project time, particularly in Weeks 2, 1 and 5, affected team collaboration and productivity.  
3. **Scope Management**  
   - The original game design proved overly ambitious, requiring significant scope reduction (e.g., reducing turns from 50 to 20 and limiting choices per category).  
4. **Godot Learning Curve**
   - The team underestimated the time needed to master Godot. Despite experience with other game engines, Godot’s unique workflow and tools posed unexpected challenges and required additional learning time.

## Lessons Learned

### Key Takeaways
1. **Early Scope Validation**  
   - Clearly defining a realistic scope early in the project is critical to avoid mid-project adjustments.  
2. **Prototyping Is Essential**  
   - Starting with a prototype facilitated better understanding of mechanics and provided a clear direction for development.  
3. **Motivation Strategies**  
   - Regular check-ins and motivational activities may help sustain team engagement during extended projects.
