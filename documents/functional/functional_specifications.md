### Economy & green house gazes

The economic and green house gaz system works in nodes. The nodes represent aspect of the Economy of a country eg. example Transportation, Education, Income etc... 

A node has two values. Money and pollution. The pollution value is proportional to the money, but the ratio between the two can change from laws.

#### Nodes 

| Name |  |
| --- | --- |
| Energy | Electricity production in the country |
| Transport | Personal and public transport |
| Education | How much money is in the education sector |
| Consumer Goods | The industry that fulfill the every day needs of the population |
| Raw Resources | All the materials and resources needed to make goods |
| Fuel | Represent all Hydrocarbon fuel including both fossil and biofuel |

#### Connection

A connection tie two monetary values together. this can often work in both directions to represent supply and demand.
eg. More money in `consumer good factory` means more money in `energy production` to represent factories increasing their energy consumption along with their output.

The specific list of connections can be found in [this table]

#### Median Income

A lot of Nodes are linked to the median income of the population. This is a unique node that doesn't directly generate pollution. Instead it leads and receive from a lot of different node and is the central element of the Game.

#### Pollution

Each node generate pollution proportionally to it's monetary value. The proportion can be changed by passing laws that reduce green house gases emissions in one or multiple nodes.

### Diplomacy

Diplomacy allows for two countries to make a number of agreements. These agreement can take two forms. UN resolution and International agreement.

#### International agreement

International agreement are accord between two countries. Those accord can concern trade, economic assistance, or research sharing.

##### Trade agreements 

Two countries can agree to a trade either resources or 

#### UN Resolution

Those are agreement between every nation to pass a particular law, to pool economic resources or to share technology.

##### UN leader

At the beginning of a turn a country becomes the UN leader and can propose a resolution. The next turn a new UN leader is chosen at random but can't be the same as the previous one.

##### Making a resolution 

The UN leader propose a resolution and all the other countries can vote to accept or reject it. If the resolution is accepted it is enforced the following turn. Otherwise nothing happens.

#### Player income

The main source of income for the player to spend in the game comes from taxing the different sector of the economy.
