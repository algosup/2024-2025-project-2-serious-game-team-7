## Reporting a Vulnerability

In case of an issue encountered in our project (like a glitch or a loading issue from our game), you can report the team in our github repository. To ensure a proper report of the problem, follow these steps:

- 1. Go in our Repository and select the "Issues" Tab.

- 2. Select "New issue".
     
Note: Make sure that you have created a github account to report an issue.

- 3. Add a short title to resume the problem encountered.

- 4. Add a description of the issue: make sure to write down what kind of problem the issue causes and the conditions of how it occurred.

- 5. Apply a label to filter the types of issue you reported (documentation, bug...).

Optional: if you are familiar with the project and with the members of its team, you can even apply an assignee who would be more certified for correcting the vulnerability.

- 6. Select "Submit new issue".

Once you submitted the Github Issue, our team behind the project will refer to it within the next 24 hours, and you should receive a mail if they find the vulnerability acceptable or declined.

Then, the assigned person(s) behind the issue will work on fixing the vulnerability 2 weeks after the problem has been reported. In case the problem has been fixed during the delay, you will receive a mail to thank you for your assistance. Either way, the github issue will be put aside, and the team should decide of its fate subsequently. 

Please, refrain from submitting any uncomplete issue report, lies or unserious jokes in the Github Issue system. In that case, you would receive a warning by mail, or even be blocked and forbidden to interact with the project.
