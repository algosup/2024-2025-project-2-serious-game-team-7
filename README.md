## Overview

**Dilemma** is a serious game designed to educate players about climate change and the rationale behind environmental policies in France. Through engaging gameplay, players explore the impacts of their decisions on global temperatures and national finances while tackling real-world challenges in diplomacy, research, and law-making. 

This project aims to:
- Sensitize players to the complexities of climate policy.
- Enhance critical thinking skills.
- Provide a better understanding of the political choices necessary to address climate issues.

The game features:
- An interactive map focused on France.
- Two gauges: one representing the financial state of the country and another tracking global temperature.
- Three decision-making categories: Diplomacy, Laws, and Research.

Our ultimate goal is to create a compelling, educational experience that enables players to learn and reflect on the multifaceted nature of climate change policies.
